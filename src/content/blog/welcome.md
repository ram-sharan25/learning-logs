# Welcome to My Learning Log

> This is the first post in what I hope will be a long journey of documenting my learning, experiments, and thoughts on software engineering.

## Why This Blog?

I've been keeping notes in Emacs for years now - scattered thoughts, code snippets, explanations of concepts I've struggled with, and lessons learned from building things. They've been incredibly valuable to me, but they've mostly sat in my local directory, helping only me.

I want to change that.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog will be a mix of:

- **Technical deep dives**: Exploring modern web technologies, from React internals to browser fundamentals
- **Learning notes**: Converted and polished versions of my personal study notes
- **Project walkthroughs**: Documentation of things I'm building and experiments I'm running
- **Thought pieces**: Reflections on software engineering, tools, and workflows
- **Book Readings**: Thoughts on current readings (books,articles).
- **Poems**: (Yes, I do write them sometimes when I can persuade words to flow through me.)
## My Current Interests

Right now, I'm particularly interested in:

- How modern web works and all of its moving parts.
- The intersection of embedded systems and web technologies


## The Tech Stack

This blog itself is built with:

- **Astro** - For blazing fast static site generation
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling with a terminal/hacker aesthetic
- **MDX** - So I can mix markdown with React components when needed
- **Vercel** - For deployment
- **Emacs** - Where I write everything in org-mode, then convert to markdown

## What's Next?

I'm working on converting some of my existing notes into publishable articles. Expect posts on topics like:

- Understanding how modern web works (end-to-end)
- Emacs workflow for this blog, daily logging, software development. etc

Stay tuned!
